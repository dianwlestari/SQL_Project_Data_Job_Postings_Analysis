# Introduction
ðŸŽ¨Exploring the Job Market Data. Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in the field of data analytics.

# Background
This dataset from a data-focused YouTuber discussing the job market. This project was born out of desire to showcase which jobs offer higher salaries and which positions are most in demand.

The data comes from [Lukebarousse.com](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql), whose explanations are easy for me to understand. Thanks to thatâœ¨, I was able to complete about half of this projectðŸŽ€.

ðŸ’¡The questions I aimed to answer through these SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For practice this into the data analyst job market, I utilize of several tools:
* Visual Studio Code: for executing SQL queries.
* PostgreSQL: for database management system
* Git & GitHub: for control and sharing my SQL script and analysis.

# The Analysis
Here's the answer to each questionðŸ’¡
