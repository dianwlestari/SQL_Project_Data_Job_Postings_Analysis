# Introduction
🎨Exploring the Job Market Data. Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in the field of data analytics.

# Background
This dataset from a data-focused YouTuber discussing the job market. This project was born out of desire to showcase which jobs offer higher salaries and which positions are most in demand.

The data comes from [Lukebarousse.com](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeBarousse), whose explanations are easy for me to understand. Thanks to that✨, I was able to complete about half of this project🎀.

💡The questions I aimed to answer through these SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For practice this into the data analyst job market, I utilize of several tools:
* Visual Studio Code: for executing SQL queries.
* PostgreSQL: for database management system
* Git & GitHub: for control and sharing my SQL script and analysis.

# The Analysis
Here's the answer to each question💡
1. Top-paying data analyst jobs
What we got from the analyst:
- The salary range is very high, the highest salary is $650.000 and the lowest is around $185.000: Shows that the top salary for Data Analyst roles varies greatly.
- The more senior or managerial the job title, the higher the salary, for example:
"Sr Data Analyst", "Head of Infrastructure Management & Data Analystics", and "Director of Safety Data Analysis".
- Job Data Analyst often appears on the job seeker portal "Ladders" for positions with high salaries.
- Insight: certain job portals may focus more on high paying or senior roles.

2. Skills are required for these top-paying jobs
What we get from the analyst:
Terlihat bahwa terdapat skill baru/niche, skill dasar tetap jadi fondasi yang wajib seperti SQL, Python, R yang menjadi top 3 skill yang dibutuhkan berdasarkan top paying

3. Skills are most in demand for data analysts
What we get from the analyst:
- Hasil dari analisis skill apa yang paling dibutuhkan untuk roles Data Analyst, terlihat SQL menempati posisi teratas (92.628 kali disebut), Excel (67.031), Python (57.326), Tableau (46.554), dan Power BI (39.468).
- Which is means SQL dan Excel masih menjadi fondasi utama kebutuhan yang harus dimiliki seorang Data Analyst.
- Terlihat bahwa 10 top skills terkait langsung dengan data management dan visualisasi.
- Sedangkan Python mendukung automation, Tableau dan Power BI kebutuhan visualisasi dimana perusahaan butuh kemampuan reporting dan dashboarding selain coding.
- Ada jarak besar antara SQL (92k) dan Power BI (39k) → menandakan core skill database & coding jauh lebih wajib ketimbang tools tambahan.
